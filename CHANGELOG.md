## 1.0.0 (March 22, 2024)
* The component is derived from the [code-component 1.2.11](https://github.com/elasticio/code-component/). A noteworthy enhancement in this version is the introduction of an authorization mechanism. This mechanism involves the use of credentials, which are available in four distinct types:
  * No Auth
  * Basic Auth
  * API Key
  * OAuth 2.0
